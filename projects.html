                <h2>CAR BLACKBOX</h2>
                <p>Car black box is a device to record driving history which can be used for car forensics in case of car accident or related crimes. It records driving data, visual data, collision data before the accident so that it can be used to analyze the accident easily and to settle many disputes related to car accidents such as crash litigation and insurance settlement. It can be used to not only reconstruct what happened before an accident by Insurance agents and police but improve vehicle design, roadway design and emergency medical service by automakers, government and hospital. It consists of data collection devices for collecting the information about car’s status and driver’s action, a non-volatile memory device for recording, a microprocessor for controlling the unit.</p>

                <h2>WATER CLEANING ROBOT</h2>
                <p>We know the fact that our rivers and other water bodies are getting polluted day by day . Plastic bottles and many other floating nonbio degradable materials are causing extinctions of aquatic organisms .More over people living in slum areas near these water bodies are bound to use this water for drinking purposes .This leads to an unhealthy society .We need to act fast before all our water bodies are gone for good.. Floating waste materials can only be taken out of deep waters by using only large boats or by expert swimmers..maybe that is the reason why normal people are not interested in doing this. After seeing this our group members has came up with an idea that will make river cleaning easy and entertaining. Our idea was to make a manual.</p>
